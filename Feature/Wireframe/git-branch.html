      <h1>What is a branch in Git?</h1>
      <p>
        A Git branch is a separate line of development within a repository.
        It allows developers to work on features or fixes independently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once changes are complete, branches can be merged back into the
        main branch, keeping the project stable and organized.
